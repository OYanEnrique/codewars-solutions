# ðŸ’» My Codewars Journey in Python

This repository serves as a personal log of my journey through Codewars, a platform for practicing and honing coding skills. Each file represents a solution to a specific coding challenge (kata) that I have completed.

## About Codewars

Codewars is a community-driven platform where developers train on coding challenges called 'katas'. These challenges range in difficulty and cover a wide variety of programming concepts, helping to improve problem-solving skills and proficiency in a programming language.

## Solutions Log

Here is a list of the katas I've solved so far in this repository:

| Day | File                 | Challenge Description                                |
|-----|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `codewarsday1.py`    | Sum of Numbers in an Array                           |
| 2   | `codewarsday2.py`    | Counting Sheep in a List                             |
| 3   | `codewarsday3.py`    | Finding the Opposite of a Number                     |
| 4   | `codewarsday4.py`    | Finding the Maximum and Minimum Values in a List     |
| 5   | `codewarsday5.py`    | Total Points in a Football Championship              |

## How to Use
